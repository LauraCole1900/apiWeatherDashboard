# Weather Dashboard

### Description

This is a weather dashboard using the third-party API from OpenWeather. The user will search a city using the provided text-box. They will then be presented with the name of the city, current date and time for that city, a five-day forecast, and the current conditions for that city. The name of the city will also appear in a button to the left of the forecast, under "History," which the user can click on to repeat the search of that city. Upon searching for a new city, the forecast and date/time will change to the new city; the newest search will display at the top of the current conditions, with previous searches moving down; and a button with the new city will appear in the "history" section. At any time, the user may revisit the forecast for a previous search by clicking on the name of that city in the "current conditions" portion of the page or the "history" portion pf the page. Upon reloading the page, the user's most recent search will appear in the "forecast" portion of the page and their search history will load as clickable buttons in the "history" portion of the page.

Forecast conditions include date, weather, high and low temperatures in Fahrenheit, relative humidity, and wind speed in mph. Current conditions include current weather, temperature in Fahrenheit, relative humidity, wind in mph, and UV index with risk level indicated by color.

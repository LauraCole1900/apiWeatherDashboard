# Weather Dashboard

### Description

This is a weather dashboard using the third-party API from OpenWeather. The user will search a city using the provided text-box. They will then be presented with the name of the city, current date and time for that city, a five-day forecast with dates presented in the user's current timezone, and the current conditions for that city. Upon searching for a new city, the forecast and date/time will change to the new city, and the newest search will display at the top of the current conditions, with previous searches moving down. At any time, the user may revisit the forecast for a previous search by clicking on the name of that city in the "current conditions" portion of the page. Upon reloading the page, the user's most recent search will appear in the "forecast" portion of the page.

Forecast conditions include date in the user's current time zone, not that of the searched city, weather, high and low temperatures in Fahrenheit, relative humidity, and wind speed in mph. Current conditions include current weather, temperature in Fahrenheit, relative humidity, wind in mph, and UV index with risk level indicated by color.
